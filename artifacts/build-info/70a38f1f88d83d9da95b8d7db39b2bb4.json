In each individual swap, the caller determines either the amount of tokens sent to or received from the Pool, depending on the `kind` value. Returns an array with the net Vault asset balance deltas. Positive amounts represent tokens (or ETH) sent to the Vault, and negative amounts represent tokens (or ETH) sent by the Vault. Each delta corresponds to the asset at the same index in the `assets` array. Swaps are executed sequentially, in the order specified by the `swaps` array. Each array element describes a Pool, the token to be sent to this Pool, the token to receive from it, and an amount that is either `amountIn` or `amountOut` depending on the swap kind. Multihop swaps can be executed by passing an `amount` value of zero for a swap. This will cause the amount in/out of the previous swap to be used as the amount in for the current one. In a 'given in' swap, 'tokenIn' must equal the previous swap's `tokenOut`. For a 'given out' swap, `tokenOut` must equal the previous swap's `tokenIn`. The `assets` array contains the addresses of all assets involved in the swaps. These are either token addresses, or the IAsset sentinel value for ETH (the zero address). Each entry in the `swaps` array specifies tokens in and out by referencing an index in `assets`. Note that Pools never interact with ETH directly: it will be wrapped to or unwrapped from WETH by the Vault. Internal Balance usage, sender, and recipient are determined by the `funds` struct. The `limits` array specifies the minimum or maximum amount of each token the vault is allowed to transfer. `batchSwap` can be used to make a single swap, like `swap` does, but doing so requires more gas than the equivalent `swap` call.

This value is useful to avoid so-called 'sandwich attacks', for example when developing price oracles.

The arguments it receives are the same that an equivalent `batchSwap` call would receive. Unlike `batchSwap`, this function performs no checks on the sender or recipient field in the `funds` struct. This makes it suitable to be called by off-chain applications via eth_call without needing to hold tokens, approve them for the Vault, or even know a user's address.

Asset Managers can manage a Pool's tokens via `managePoolBalance`, depositing and withdrawing them directly, and can even set their balance to arbitrary amounts. They are therefore expected to be highly secured smart contracts with sound design principles, and the decision to register an Asset Manager should not be made lightly.
